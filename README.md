Gitting it.

Yodels,

My name is Zach and I'm FINALLY learning to code.  After working for years & years in fields that ultimately didn't inspire me, I'm hoping to find a new creative outlet that could potentially turn into a new career. 

Ideally, I will find a way to work with video games.  

As a way to mark progress and keep myself motivated, I thought it would be best to document this endeavor using GitHub.

Here we go!
